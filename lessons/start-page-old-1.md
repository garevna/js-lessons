# ![ico-30 icon] JS

### ![ico-20 question] OOP

**JS** cannot be strictly called an object-oriented language because it violates some principles of object-oriented programming. The prototype-based inheritance model essentially involves delegation rather than inheritance as understood in languages with a class-based inheritance model.

In JS, **functions rule, not classes**.

### ![ico-20 question] Polymorphism

If you want to experience true **polymorphism**, you need JS.
Here, polymorphism starts from the very first step.
In JavaScript, polymorphism manifests itself through various mechanisms such as function overloading, prototypical inheritance, and dynamic typing. These features make JS a powerful and flexible development tool.

It's mind-boggling!
Implicit type coercion puzzles many because they do not know the engine allows you to control this process.

So "Goodbye, class inheritance model!" and long live the functional freedom of JS!

### ![ico-20 icon] Func-style

@@@@
**JS** incorporates many nice features from **functional programming languages** (such as _chaining computations_, _currying_).<br><br>Func-style in JS is a direct consequence of the aforementioned, and importantly, it forms the foundation of asynchrony.

**Asynchrony** relies on callbacks, i.e., **_functions_**.
In short, JS is built on functions, and this is not just a principle of executing individual tasks, but rather a way of the language's existence, its main essence. The main features of the language - prototype-based inheritance and asynchrony - are implemented through functions.

### ![ico-20 icon] Jazz
JS - it's jazz, it's improvisation, it's fantastic freedom.
But freedom comes with responsibility.

It's essential to deeply understand what the engine will do when interpreting your line of code.
The engine is powerful, so putting someone who can't drive behind the wheel of an HMMWV is complete madness.

Even worse is letting a novice "steer" an F35.<br><br>Dive in, guys! With persistence and patience.<br><br>**Have a great flight with JS!**
